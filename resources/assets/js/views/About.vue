                            All data is from Nielsen Media. Take it with a grain of salt as Nielsen has a very specific method of measuring viewers. Things that have historically not been taken into consideration are DVR views and streaming.

                            Yeah, actually there was and they won fair and square. In this alpha stage of the project, they are going to be classified as a promoter despite not being a promoter because adding in functionality just for one entity would have caused some unnecessary headache. We plan on adding it in and going back and re-assigning promoters to all of their cards. Sorry to TGB, Warriors, DiBella, Kings, RingStar and any others whose hard work has been essentially ignored (for now) for the sake of ease. You will be added in and get your proper credit in due time. (Although in some cases maybe you don't want to credit.)

                                 Short answer: we are. Long answer: That's possible and very likely because on another site they are talking about peak viewers or the average viewers for a particular fight. We go by average viewers for the entire telecast. You will notice that lots of outlets will try to pass off whatever number suits their narrative they're trying to get across and don't spotlight the full numbers. We verify the numbers across many sources to ensure that they're all accurate.

                                 They are coming in soon. The thinking hasn't been done yet to implement them. Plus, there are other things we want to add in when it comes to pay-per-view like ticket sales and attendance. Those numbers haven't been gathered yet.

                                Simple. Showtime doesn't have as many subscribers as HBO. When considering each network's ratings, one thing you can do is make a ratio to create a baseline. Another way to say that is to have a level playing field so that you can make fair comparisons between the two.

                                This database is not complete by any means. Finding ratings isn't as easy as going to ratings.com and pulling up a card. There are white whale cards I have where I've searched and searched and could not find any reported number. (Barker-Geale, Frampton-Quigg to name a couple). Over the coming weeks and months we will be adding in a lot of missing cards from the past few years as well as start working our way back to give some historical comparison.

                                 Undercard fights are coming soon. There's some stuff on the back end that needs sorting and it will take time to add in all the undercards. It's a huge task especially with those Showtime quadruple headers we occasionally get.

                                Absolutely. If you have some ratings that we don't have, send them in. You can <a href="mailto:sundaypuncherboxing@gmail.com?subject=Boxing%20Rating" target="_top">email us</a>. Be sure to include the date, venue, network, the time the card started, and who was on it. Obviously we'll be going to BoxRec to double check everything, but it doesn't hurt. Lastly, be sure to include the actual average viewers for the entire card. We don't go by fight because those ratings are sparse.
