What better way to determine the health of the sport than a tool which could serve as the equivalent of a doctor checking the vital signs. This is not complete, the database will take time to populate (it's all done manually through hard work and dedication), and it will evolve over time with cool things like graphs and charts and other 21st century stuff that eludes the sport we love.</h3>
