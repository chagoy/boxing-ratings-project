# boxing-ratings-project

View the live version at http://boxingratingsdb.com

This is my dream project. It's not the most complicated, but it does exactly what I want it to do. I wanted to solve the problem of arguing about which boxer is more popular. While there are other ways to determine popularity, TV ratings are a big one. This site allows a user to search a boxer, find a network, find a location, or even a promoter and look up their history on TV. 

The data isn't complete, but it's a good start for a very convoluted sport.

I built this as a Single Page App using Vue.js and the back end is handled with Laravel. I used Bulma for my front end framework.
